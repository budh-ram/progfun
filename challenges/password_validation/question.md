#### Numeric Password Validation

The user sends a numeric password of 6 characters through a form. In order to force secure passwords create a validation that the numbers cannot consecutively go up or down. (e.g. 23456 or 98765 should raise the validation).

Sidenote: don't worry about the 9 to 0 transition, 10987 does NO raise the validation.
