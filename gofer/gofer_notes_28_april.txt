- speed d t = d / t   =  speed d t = (/) d t
- :t - to check type of any expression
- Type Inference - Gofer has advanced type system and automatically try to
  detect type of variable if not mentioned

- function
  fact x
    | x <  2 = 1
    | otherwise = x * fact(x - 1)

- fibonacci series and 'where' keyword to create local binding
  fib x
    | x == 0 = 1
    | x == 1 = 1
    | otherwise = first + second
      where first = fib(x - 1)
      second = fib(x - 2)
- speed = (/)  means speed is new label that is given to function already defined by operator '/'
- Gofer has lazy evaluation. It means expression is not evaluated until it is used
- In Gofer, every function is partial function
